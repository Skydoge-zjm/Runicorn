## Contributing to Architecture Docs

When contributing to architecture documentation:

1. **Focus on design, not usage** - Explain "why" and "how it works", not "how to use"
2. **Include diagrams** - Use Mermaid or ASCII art for visual explanations
3. **Explain trade-offs** - Document alternatives considered and why rejected
4. **Keep updated** - Update when architecture changes significantly
