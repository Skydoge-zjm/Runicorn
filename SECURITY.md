# Security Policy

## Supported versions
The project is currently in early development (alpha). Security updates are addressed on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Please avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities until a fix is available.
- Temporarily use one of the following:
  - Open a private report channel (GitHub Security Advisory once the repo is public), or
  - Email the maintainer: jmzhangskydoge@gmail.com

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
- Affected versions and environment

The maintainers will respond to reports as soon as possible. (Maybe not very soon ...)
